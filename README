Playbird is a simple Play! Framework plugin that provides website traffic visualizations via websockets.

Largly ripped off from hummingbird js -> http://hummingbirdstats.com/
Special thanks to smoothie charts     -> http://smoothiecharts.org/

After you install it if you visit /playbird/ with a websocket enabled browser (tested in latest Chrome)
you can test it out. Demo to come shortly.
