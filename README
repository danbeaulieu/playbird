PLAYBIRD
===========

Playbird is a simple Play! Framework plugin that provides website traffic visualizations via websockets.

Largly ripped off from hummingbird js -> http://hummingbirdstats.com/
Special thanks to smoothie charts     -> http://smoothiecharts.org/


Description
---------------

Serves a 1 pixel image at /playbird/tracking and sends this to any browser with a websocket connection open at
/playbird/websocket. After you install it you visit /playbird/ with a websocket enabled browser (tested in latest Chrome) to test it out


Requirements
-------------------

 * Play! Framework 1.2.4


Installation
--------------

    Update your dependencies.yaml 


TODO
------------

Lots to do:

* Use a database (hummingbird uses mongo, so why not)
* Aggregate the data in the db
* Add some sweet map action
* Add script to easily import in to any page
* Add multiple buckets to track different metrics
